###Steps to run on ubuntu:

There are prereq installs for pip but currently I do not know which. Once Ive had a chance to look into that this will be updated

  1. Copy the python file to its own folder
  2. python3 ./fishcalc.py
       The program will then begin creating its own file tree within which it will operate
       when the main menu is brought up if you have cards already you can exit and continue preparations
  3. If you have cards to use to start with this is where you add them. otherwise this will be where you will do initial setup
    A. If you have cards sorted into folders already you can add them or if you they arent sorted you can add them to the import folder and then run it inside the program
    B. If you do not have any cards you may have to open the card viewer option and create them. The optimal order to create them in is going category by category for food, fish, tank, fishroom so that you wind up backtracking the least adding things later.

###Note to Consider
When editting files using this program it does not consider readability for later at times. This is something which I will need to fix later but for now this means if you edit something wrong you will have to be the one to fix it and it might not be obvious how its wrong to anyone else. So when possible its best to stick to edits which you are confident in making
